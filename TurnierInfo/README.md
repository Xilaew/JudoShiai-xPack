# What is TurnierInfo
TurnierInfo makes it easy to setup the Network for a Judo Tournament with JudoShiai. With TurnierInfo everything you need to publish tournament results live in a local WiFi network is included inside a WiFi Router. And you do not need to worry about any network details, everything is secure and easy to use.

TurnierInfo provides two securely separeted WiFi networks:

* one for the public audience with a Captive Portal where guests can download all information provided by [JudoShiai](http://www.judoshiai.fi/index-en.php).
* another network for communication of the different JudoShiai programms (JudoWeight, JudoTimer ...) among each other, from this network JudoShiai can upload the results via ftp.
